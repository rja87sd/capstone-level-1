# Looking For Gamers

## Project Description

Looking For Gamers is a social forum style web site for TTRPG players to find other TTRPG players. Users will be able to post ads that tell a bit about themselves and the kind of game they are wanting to play with others, or to post ads for openings in an already existing gaming group.

## Problem Statement

In a post-COVID world, a lot of tabletop gaming groups have moved online and physical hangout spots have become less-frequented. Looking For Gamers aims to help people once again enjoy their favorite hobby by bringing people back together, be it online or in person.
